## More than **100 JavaScript Exercises** that I have been doing since I have started my journey

Beginner Friendly  
Some are simple logic exercises others are mini-projects.
[Demo](https://rs-coding.github.io/JavaScript-Exercises/)

Let's Go!
### OpenSource

#### whoever wants to practice and contribute with new solutions:

- go to the **dev** branch and fork that branch by clicking on **fork** button
- copy the **url** of the document
- at your terminal write **git clone <url>** to download and work locally
- do the exercises in your code editor
- save the files exactly has they are with the same titles as mine using the commands **git add .** and **git commit -m "text"**
- after saving to your local repository do a **git push origin dev** to your github repository(forked file based on mine)
- go to my original project and make a **"pull request"**
